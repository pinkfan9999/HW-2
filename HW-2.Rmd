## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Nobody
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far: 6 hours
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](http://rpubs.com/pinkfan9999/HW-2).
* What gave you the most trouble: Figuring out how to filter out Comedies and Non-Comedies in the dataset.
* Any comments you have:



## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

# Gender and Income

income_data <-profiles %>%  group_by(sex) %>% select(sex,income)

ggplot(data=income_data, aes(x=sex,y=income)) +geom_boxplot()

# Some Large Outliers skewing the dataset.
income_data <- income_data %>% filter(income < 100000)
ggplot(data=income_data, aes(x=sex,y=income)) +geom_boxplot()

# Since Income is self-reported, -1 means chose not to report.
#-1 is largely reported
ggplot(data=profiles, aes(x=income)) +geom_histogram()

#Make -1 categorical
profiles <- profiles %>% mutate(income_reported = (income>-1))

# Gender vs. Diet

diet_data <- profiles %>%  group_by(sex) %>% select(sex,diet) %>% filter(is.na(diet)==FALSE)

#Compile categories
diet_data <- diet_data %>% mutate(diet = fct_recode(diet,"anything" = "anything", "religious diet/other"="halal", "religious diet/other"="kosher", "anything"="mostly anything" , "religious diet/other"="mostly halal" , "religious diet/other"="mostly kosher","religious diet/other"= "mostly other","vegetarian/vegan"= "mostly vegan", "vegetarian/vegan"="mostly vegetarian", "religious diet/other"="other", "anything" = "strictly anything", "religious diet/other"="strictly halal", "religious diet/other"="strictly kosher", "religious diet/other"="strictly other" , "vegetarian/vegan"="strictly vegan" , "vegetarian/vegan"="strictly vegetarian" , "vegetarian/vegan"="vegan", "vegetarian/vegan"="vegetarian"))

diet_prop <- diet_data %>% group_by(sex, diet) %>% tally()
diet_total <- diet_data %>% group_by(diet) %>% tally()
diet_sex_prop <-full_join(diet_prop,diet_total, by="diet") %>% mutate(proportion = n.x/n.y)

# Total number of people on each diet.
diet_total
# Proportion of males and females on each diet.
ggplot(data=diet_sex_prop, aes(x=sex, y=proportion)) +geom_bar(stat="identity") + facet_wrap(~diet)

# Total number of males and females on each diet.
ggplot(data=diet_prop, aes(x=sex, y=n)) +geom_bar(stat="identity") + facet_wrap(~diet)



```

Since most people choose not to report income, this is not a good predictor
for gender.

Predicting gender based on job is a decent predictor variable, because the number
of people in each job category is relatively high.

Predicting gender based on diet is not necessarily the best, because , even when consolidating categories, non-anything diets have relatively low counts of people in them.


## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
